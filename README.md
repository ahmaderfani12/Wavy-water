# Wavy Water

It's my attempt to create a wavy water shader using Gerstner waves and the Tessellation technique for better performance in Unity/HLSL. It's an ongoing project, and I'm always trying to add new features and resolve issues in my free time.

## Features
Control over:
- Three Gerstner waves
- Tessellation
- Depth based transparency
- Foam based on waves height and depth

## To Do
- Fixing Normal calculation issues on sharp wave peaks
- Optimizing variables precision
- Using a Flow map for wave directions
